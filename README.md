# eidos
eidos - Python functions to extract of 2D shape measurements from binary images.

## Introduction
**Eidos** is the greek word for shape. Quantitative measurement of particle shapes based on binary images is used in many fields. However, right now there is no comprehensive Python package that allows fast and easy computation of the variety of different shape measurements proposed in the scientific literature. Here **eidos** comes in.

We unify different coordinate systems, conventions and data formats to calculate - fast and easy - the shape measurements of particles defined as 2d binary images.

## Dependencies

*Eidos* is based on 2d binary images that are defined as NumPy arrays. Where exisisting, we use the powerfull implementation of scikit-image and OpenCV as well as functions given by NumPy and SciPy. **eidos** is developed in Python 3.7.

To use **eidos** you need the following Python packages:
  * [NumPy](https://www.numpy.org/)
  * [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)
  * [scikit-image](https://www.scikit-image.org/)
  * [opencv](https://www.opencv.org/)
  * [pandas](https://www.pandas.pydata.org/)
